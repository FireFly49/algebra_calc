- What kind of stuff do I want to include in the algebra calculator? 
  (These are some things I could include to work with)

1. Polynomials expansion, simplification and factoring up
2. Logarithms, trigonometry, exponentials use within expressions
3. Index and surd laws simplification and use within expressions
4. Differentiation and simple integration (of functions)
5. Solving equations (some simple ones maybe?)
